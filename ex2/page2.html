                <h1>Weather</h1>
                <p>Thailand's climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal<br> character (the southwest and northeast monsoon).The southwest monsoon,<br> which starts from May until October is characterised by movement of warm,<br> moist air from the Indian Ocean to Thailand, causing abundant rain over most<br> of the country. The northeast monsoon, starting from October until February brings<br> cold and dry air from China over most of Thailand.</p>
